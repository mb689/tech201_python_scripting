## What is python scripting
- A Python script is best defined as a Python file that contains commands in logical order. For this to be considered a script, the program should do something—really, anything—when it's run through the Python interpreter.

## Python Scripting vs Python Coding
- The main difference between both is scripting languages don't require any compilation and are directly interpreted. The compiled codes execute faster than the interpreted codes as they are changed in to a native machine program.
